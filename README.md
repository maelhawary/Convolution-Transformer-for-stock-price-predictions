# Transformer-for-stock-price-predictions

This project is a pytorch implementation for pretraining a transformer-based model to perform stock-price predictions. The model is trained on EUR/USD forex pairs but you can change the input file by any other stock-price pairs. The transformer-based model is a variant from the vanilla transformer.. . The architecture is shown in the following figure 


# Results: 

The model performs very well in traing, test, and validation dataset with MSE less than E-3

# To run
